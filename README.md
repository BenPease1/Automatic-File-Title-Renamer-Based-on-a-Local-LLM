I'm not sure if anybody will find this useful since it's slow and uses JavaScript that would have been easier to use Python... Anyways, if you have a local vision model installed, like I have in this code through LM Studio, then this takes files from a folder and outputs them with new names into a separate folder. If you actually want to use it, you'll have to change all of the paths and stuff. I also use this Apple Automator so that it just automatically creates names for my files whenever I scan papers to that folder, which is kind of helpful.
